# H-STAR
Hierarchical Speech Therapy for Aphasia Recommender

More information forthcoming. Here is how you can get started.

Download the version of h-STAR most appropriate for you: 
1. hSTAR_mlapp --> this is a matlab app and can only be run with a matlab license. It will work on either windows or mac with matlab installed (use version 22b and above if possible)
2. hSTAR_windows --> this is a compiled matlab app and can be run without a matlab license. Just follow the readme in the folder for installation instructions.
3. hSTAR_mac --> this is a compiled matlab app and can be run without a matlab license (note, it's a bit harder to run than the standalone windows version of hSTAR). Just follow the readme in the folder for installation instructions.
4. batch_process --> this is matlab code for batch processing multiple subjects' data. This requires a matlab license. (just open the live code .mlx file in matlab).

To understand the order of features that need to be input and what each feature means, see example.csv which comes with every version of the app (see notes column).
For batch processing, see example_batch.csv in the ./batch_process directory. If editing features within the app, the order of features is fixed.
