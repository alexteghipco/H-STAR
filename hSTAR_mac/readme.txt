If you have a matlab license, download h-STAR_mlapp instead. Open matlab, navigate to the ./hSTAR_mlapp directory and type hSTAR into your command window. If you do not have a matlab license, use this directory instead. Then:

Step 1: Download matlab runtime, which is free (make sure to get version 9.12): https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html 

Step 2: Open terminal

Step 3: Navigate to the hSTAR_mac/for_redistribution_files_only directory by typing:cd /path/to/hSTAR_mac/for_redistribution_files_only

Step 4: type:./run_hSTAR.sh /Applications/MATLAB/MATLAB_Runtime/v912

* the first time you run this, it may take some time. You may also need to adjust /Applications/MATLAB/MATLAB_Runtime depending on where you installed runtime
